## Introduction

CRUD serverless example
It uses the AWS serverless framework and can write data to an AWS postgres database.
This app is also linted with esling and it also uses prettier.
It is also set up so that the different formats do not clash. Check out .eslintrc

##
I didn't actually deploy it because of issues with my internet connection. 
But I made all of the modifications and implemented the api functionality to secure it.
This is done on serverless.yml


### Useful commands

```
serverless offline start      to start it offline.
```
To send a header you need to set a header key
```x-api-key
